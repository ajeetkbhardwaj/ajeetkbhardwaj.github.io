I am currently a Research Intern at the Cloud Computing Lab and HIPC Lab, IIT Delhi, where I focus on building and evaluating LLM-based tools that automatically generate OpenAPI specifications from source API code.

Before joining IIT Delhi, I completed my M.Sc in Mathematics and Computing at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi, where I worked at the DST-CIMS. My Master’s thesis was centered around [Discrete Differential Geometry and its Applications](master-thesis.pdf), supervised by [Prof. Bankteshwar Tiwari](https://www.bhu.ac.in/Site/FacultyProfile/45_233?FA000189).


My academic journey began with a B.Sc (Hons) in Applied Mathematics from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi. Along the way, I also pursued a **[Data Science Specialization](https://gist.github.com/ajeetkbhardwaj/136fa8181ce1e21ab91747a752bf4eb5)** through NPTEL (IIT Madras), strengthening my skills in **Programming, Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Large Language Models**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of:
- Discrete Differential Geometry and its Applications
- Modeling Complex Systems and Simulations
- Data Science and Machine Learning

I’m deeply fascinated by how mathematical models and machine learning tools can work together to solve real-world problems and advance research in scientific computing and AI-driven automation.

Research Experiances
=====

## 0. Research Intern (IIT Delhi)
*Cloud Computing and HIPC Lab (June-Present)*
1. **LLM + OpenAPI Specification** 
   - *An automated tool was already build that extracts URLs, HTTP methods, request handlers, and dependencies from API source code, integrates them into curated prompt templates, and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate OpenAPI specifications.*

   - *My major contribution on this project was to testing the tool on python api such as treeherder, education-backend and django-DefectDojo etc. Our tool out perform, the other existing static compilation based tools such as Respector etc.*

2. **Multi-Agents + OpenAPI Specification**
   - Build mult-agents system for the openapi specification generation from the given API source code.

## 1. [Quantum Research Intern (QWorld)](https://gist.github.com/ajeetkbhardwaj/6595815a2af97a9326ebdf4ebe41bd16)
*Online(July to August 2024)*
- Implemented the HHL algorithm using Qiskit to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on the Wave Equation.
- Designed and executed quantum circuits on both simulators and IBM Quantum hardware, scaling computations up to 50+ qubits.
- Explored advanced quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA), and Shor's Algorithm etc.

## 2. [Machine Learning Intern (Devtern)](https://gist.github.com/ajeetkbhardwaj/0e7c9f663c0582d3e39c509d0302c8e5)
*Online(Feb to April 2024)*
- Developed accurate ML models using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees for Heart Disease Prediction and House Price Estimation, achieving over 90% accuracy.
- Built end-to-end ML pipelines, incorporating model design, training, optimization, and deployment via API development.
- Performed data preprocessing, including cleaning, feature transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from complex datasets.
- Applied techniques such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation to enhance performance and interpretability of solutions.
