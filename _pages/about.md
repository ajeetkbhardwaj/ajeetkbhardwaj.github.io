I am currently a Research Intern at the Cloud Computing Lab and HIPC Lab, IIT Delhi, where I focus on building and evaluating LLM-based tools that automatically generate OpenAPI specifications from source API code.

Before joining IIT Delhi, I completed my M.Sc in Mathematics and Computing at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi, where I worked at the DST-CIMS. My Master’s thesis was centered around [Discrete Differential Geometry and its Applications](master-thesis.pdf), supervised by Prof. Bankteshwar Tiwari.


My academic journey began with a B.Sc (Hons) in Applied Mathematics from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi. Along the way, I also pursued a **Data Science Specialization** through NPTEL (IIT Madras), strengthening my skills in **Programming, Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Large Language Models**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of:
- Discrete Differential Geometry and its Applications
- Modeling Complex Systems and Simulations
- Data Science and Machine Learning

I’m deeply fascinated by how mathematical models and machine learning tools can work together to solve real-world problems and advance research in scientific computing and AI-driven automation.
