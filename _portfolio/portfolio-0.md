The Disease Detection Web Application, developed in 2022, is a machine learning-powered platform designed to assist in the early detection of diseases, with a focus on accessibility and efficiency. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to analyze medical data, such as X-ray images, and provide accurate diagnostic predictions. Built using Python and Flask for the backend, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, the application integrates seamlessly with user inputs to deliver results in real-time.

The application employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-based disease detection, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. It was specifically designed during the COVID-19 pandemic to aid in the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-rays, addressing the urgent need for scalable diagnostic tools. The project demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare by offering a cost-effective and user-friendly solution for disease diagnosis.

Looking ahead, the application can be expanded to detect a broader range of diseases, integrate with electronic health records, and improve diagnostic accuracy with larger datasets.
